# Python Is Slow

So slow in fact, that I wanted to take code I wrote for a meme I recently made
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/17qz4kn/imreallymemoryefficientdontworryabtit/"><img src="https://preview.redd.it/drcb6mksl7zb1.png?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=70c20cf53a13e6d3393ff31ef42a9530e0fb8e6f" style="width:50%" /></a>
And I wanted to put it up to the test against Python!

Good luck Python (I know you'll need it) and I'll put the results up here after I run the test
